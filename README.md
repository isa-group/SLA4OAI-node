# SLA for Open API Initiative Library
## 1. Introduction
**SLA4OAI** is an open source standard for describing SLA in APIs.

Based on the standards proposed by the [OAI](https://openapis.org/specification), SLA4OAI builds on top of it to add 
an optional profile for defining SLA (Service Level Agreements) over the APIs.

This SLA definition in a neutral vendor flavour will allow to foster innovation in the area where APIs expose and documents its SLA, 
API Management tools can import and measure such key metrics and composed SLAs for composed services aggregated way in a standard way.
